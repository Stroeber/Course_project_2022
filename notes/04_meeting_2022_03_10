Meeting with Jens, Maik, Steffen

While Maik tried to classify the rain calls, he found problems with some
audio files, i.e. there are some recordings where multiple birds are
calling. In those cases we would have to manually single out the calls,
if the clear recordings are not enough to train the network.

Steffen worked on a script, that automatically single out the rain calls into
0.25 second bits and create the respective spectrogram to feed in our network.

Steffen will be on holiday until from 12.03-19.03.

Jens has already looked into some possible architectures and will dive deeper
until the 19.03. He now also has some example data to run though the NN.

Maik will sort out more recordings till the same date.

Our plan is to train and optimise our network until the 23.03 and get a first
draft of our report until 27.03. Maik will also write an e-mail to Charlie since
we are unclear of the scope of our report and we couldn't find anything specific
about it somewhere.

Maik also propoesed to go though the original paper his Grandpa wrote to get a
better understanding of the field.

Next meeting is tomorrow 11.03 at 17:30 to go through Steffens script, so the rest
can work with it while he is gone.
