Meeting with everyone

-Steffen played around with a script to cut a long audio file with multiple
  raincalls into smaller files with only one raincalls, so we can use it
  as input for our model.
-We also put up a github in which we store all the data, writing, scripts and
  what else comes up.
-Maik got some new data files and we agreed, that he will classify them and
  put them into separate folders, so Steffens scripts can access them easily
  and put the cut audio files into a seperate folder with the original file.
-Jens will have a look at different model architectures and start building a
  model in parallel to be more time efficient.
-Steffen will further work on the script so it can produce the data we feed
  into our model.
-The next meeting is scheduled for Thursday 10.03.22 at noon.
