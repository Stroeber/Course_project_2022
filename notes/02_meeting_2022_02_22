Meeting with Jens, Maik, Steffen

Making a decision on our project:
  -We all think using the dataset of Maiks Grandpa (Dr. Hans-Heiner Bergmann)
  would be more interesting than just searching for a Dataset online.
  -The problem we see is preparing the data, since the raw data, as we understood,
  consists of mostly unlabeled .mp3, .wav and video files of different lengths.
  -There a also multiple bird calls on a single file so we might have to single them out.
  -Ideas on how to tackle that problem:
    -Since the Bird calls we want to analyse should be the loudest parts of the recordings,
    we could use a threshold to find them and cut out a second before and after that point
    to single out the individual calls.
    -The next step would be to label the data by hand, which Maik generously proposed to do.
  -At this point in time we do not have the dataset, the next step is to obtain the full set,
  so we can get a better idea of our tasks.
  -Maik will also write an E-mail to Charlie (out Tutor) to update her on our decision and
  maybe find a date for a meeting with her, although we do not think it is necessary at this point.
