Meeting with Jens, Maik, Steffen

Finding our project:
  -We tried to narrow our choices of what we want to do for our project

  -We thought about doing something with birds, since Maiks grandpa is an Ornithology
    Professor and has a lot of self-collected data
  -One possibility is classifying songbird dialects:
    -A more specific variant of the BirdNet, which concentrates on classifying regional bird
      dialects (Osnabrück has 5 Buchfinken dialects) using self-recorded data
    -Wait for feedback from Maik, who is trying to get the data
    -Seems a bit more risky, since we don't know how the data will look like and
    if its usable

  -Alternative is using a dataset from a kaggle competition and base our project on that
    -More safe since we know the dataset us usable
    -The specific challenges we are looking at are:
      -Turtle Recall (active): Develop a model that is able to distinguish between specific
        turtles and, if it’s a new one, give it a new name or tag.

      -BirdClef (active): similar to our idea, identify bird songs, but for rare and endangered species.

      -Herbarium (active): Challenge to build tools to identify novel plant species based on herbaria
